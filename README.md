# What is Exponential Platform?

## Recent improvements to Exponential Platform
Exponential Platform (the application of interest) delivered to users worldwide by a web server (PHP built-in, Apache, Nginx, lighttpd, Among others).

With PHP we require composer to install Exponential Platform software and no other software required to run
the application. This is an incredible improvement to the kernel (core) of Exponential Platform.

## What does Exponential Platform provide for end users building websites?

Exponential Platform is a professional PHP application framework with advanced CMS (content management system) functionality. As a CMS its most notable feature
is its fully customizable and extendable content model.
It is also suitable as a platform for general PHP development, allowing
you to develop professional Internet applications, fast.

Standard CMS functionality, like news publishing and forums is
built in and ready for you to use. Its stand-alone libraries can be
used for cross-platform, secure, database independent PHP projects.

Exponential Platform is database, platform and browser independent. Because it is
browser based it can be used and updated from anywhere as long as you have
access to the Internet.

(Referred to as `new stack` in Exponential Platform 5.x and Ibexa OSS)

# What is eZ Platform?

Exponential Platform is based on the successfull product, eZ Platform, is a highly extensible, pure Content Managment Platform built upon the ideals core to Symfony. It provides the same flexible content model at it's core like Exponential Platform, and has a growing amount of additional features outside the traditional CMS scope provided by means of "Bundles"
extending it.

It is built on top of the full Symfony Framework, giving developers access to "standard" tools for rapid web & application development.

eZ Platform in some users view suffered a slow road to a stable datatype compatability with existing custom implementations of Exponential Platform. Today all of these conserns are now gone with a solid choice left leaving both Exponential Platform Platform and eZ Platform as serious contenders to be carefully considered. [Netgen's Media Website Core software](https://github.com/netgen/media-site) represents a much more modern eZ Platform core powered by Ibexa OSS. If your going to choose; Choose wisely.
