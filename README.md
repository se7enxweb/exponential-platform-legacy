# What is Exponential?

## Recent improvements to Exponential
Exponential (the application of interest) delivered to users worldwide by a web server (PHP built-in, Apache, Nginx, lighttpd, Among others).

Exponential with a full complement of all popular and available php extensions installed like SQLite3 users no longer require a dedicated database server anymore with Exponential 6.

With PHP we require composer to install Exponential software and no other software required to run
the application. This is an incredible improvement to the kernel (core) of Exponential.

## What does Exponential provide for end users building websites?

Exponential is a professional PHP application framework with advanced CMS (content management system) functionality. As a CMS its most notable feature
is its fully customizable and extendable content model.
It is also suitable as a platform for general PHP development, allowing
you to develop professional Internet applications, fast.

Standard CMS functionality, like news publishing, e-commerce and forums is
built in and ready for you to use. Its stand-alone libraries can be
used for cross-platform, secure, database independent PHP projects.

Exponential is database, platform and browser independent. Because it is
browser based it can be used and updated from anywhere as long as you have
access to the Internet.

(Referred to as `legacy` in Exponential Platform 5.x and Ibexa OSS)

# What is eZ Platform?

Exponential's technological successor, eZ Platform, is a highly extensible, pure Content Managment Platform built upon the ideals core to Symfony. It provides the same flexible content model at it's core like Exponential, and has a growing amount of additional features outside the traditional CMS scope provided by means of "Bundles"
extending it.

It is built on top of the full Symfony Framework, giving developers access to "standard" tools for rapid web & application development.

eZ Platform in some users view suffered a slow road to a stable datatype compatability with existing custom implementations of Exponential. Today all of these conserns are now gone with a solid choice left leaving both Exponential Platform and eZ Platform as serious contenders to be carefully considered. [Netgen's Media Website Core software](https://github.com/netgen/media-site) represents a much more modern eZ Platform core powered by Ibexa OSS. If your going to choose; Choose wisely.

# What is Ibexa DXP OSS?

Staying true to the foundational principles of Exponential, it retains the flexible content model at its core while expanding its capabilities to include a broad spectrum of features that go beyond traditional CMS functionality. These features are delivered through "Bundles," providing developers with powerful tools for creating advanced web and digital solutions.

Built on top of Symfony, Ibexa DXP OSS offers developers access to standardized tools for efficient and scalable web and application development. Its architecture supports rapid innovation while ensuring compatibility with modern development standards.

Ibexa DXP OSS has matured into a robust and versatile platform, serving as a serious option for organizations seeking a cutting-edge CMS solution.
